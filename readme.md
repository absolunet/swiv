# SWIV
/swiv/ (haitian creole) - Follow, track.

## What is Swiv?
Swiv is a JavaScript library that makes website tracking implementation easier.
It procures a fluent and modular API to send data to Google analytic systems, such as Analytics, Tag Manager, and Enhanced Ecommerce.
It is dependency-free, back-end agnostic, with the possibility to replace any legacy singleton within the core by our own.
It can be implemented anywhere, from a VanillaJS environment to a PWA built on top of your favorite JS framework.


## Requirements
